# bookmarks

## About:
Bookmarks sharing web app. Practice project using Python/Flask/SQLite technologies. Based on pluralsight course 
[Introduction to the Flask Microframework](https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/flask-micro-framework-introduction).

## My work:
The biggest problem to solve in this course was the adoption from python2(course) to python3(my choice). 
I learned a lot about databases migration, alembic, blueprints.
